# ML_project
Project for ML coursee

Done in 4 people including myself. We have chosen a Kaggle competition about <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/h-and-m-personalized-fashion-recommendations">Personalized Recommending System for H&M</a>.
Unfortunately this project was to0 hard for our competences but we learned from it many thinks like embedding and that data processing is very important.
In this folder I present 4 files `main.py`, `ActivationFunctions.py`, `OurNeuralNetwork.py` and `embeddingTS.py` I wrote totally by myself.
It was my first contact with embedding that is why this file might be a little bit chaotic.

In `main.py` I was testing different networks but at the end we didn't manage to create efficient neural network.
